## DevOps Engineer Task

As a DevOps Engineer at Crewmeister, you will be in charge of several challenging tasks in your daily work. One of your core responsibilities will be to ensure that the system is always running smoothly and that the application is deployed successfully to our customers.

In this challenge, you should use DevOps best practices to architect and implement the complete cycle of building, packaging, and deploying a Java application (specified later in this document). 

The following are core technologies/tools that should be present in the solution:

- Dockerfile
- Helm Chart
- Terraform to interact with the Kubernetes cluster

You have the flexibility to utilize any cloud provider of your choice to deploy and run the application effectively. Additionally, it should be designed to operate seamlessly on local machines, allowing for a versatile setup that caters to various operational preferences and environments.

## Plus:

- Create a CI Pipeline in Github to automate the application lifecycle

- Add monitoring tools to check the health of the application

## Important Points:

- At Crewmeister, we value creativity and pushing for better. You are encouraged to expand the solution as you find fit. To do so, you must ensure high-quality documentation and that the base solution is correctly executed.
- All the tools used must be publicly accessible or explicitly documented on how to authenticate.
- All the tools must be free to use.
